    "#### versions 3 and 4 were github issues (okay, <i>my</i> issues) that involved a rebase i'm pretty sure went all the way to the top of github. i'm expecting my 'please refrain from saving any of your work ever' letter from them soon.\n",
    "#### at any rate, this notebook is meant to dive into an api and clean it up for prompt engineering use.\n",
    "#### as a prompt engineer, interacting with api data is key, but you also have to keep an eye on how that api is billing you for its use, namely in the form of call numbers and tokens. while different apis bill different ways, a popular way to charge for their api use (you're paying for their servers) is to charge you based on either the tokens consumed and or the number of daily calls to their api.\n",
    "#### while the api we'll be working with is free to use, accessible to all, and offensible to no one (the cat api (found <a href=\"https://thecatapi.com/\" target =\"_blank\">here</a>)), it is good to know your api usage to help monitor your costs.\n",

The British is a fiercely loyal, loving cat and will attach herself to every one of her family members. While loving to play, she doesn't need hourly attention. If she is in the mood to play, she will find someone and bring a toy to that person. The British also plays well by herself, and thus is a good companion for single people.   \n",

The British is a fiercely loyal, loving cat and will attach herself to every one of her family members. While loving to play, she doesn't need hourly attention. If she is in the mood to play, she will find someone and bring a toy to that person. The British also plays well by herself, and thus is a good companion for single people.   \n",

They love having fun, donâ€™t mind the company of other cats and dogs, also love to curl up for a sleep in a safe place. Exotics love their own people, but around strangers they are cautious at first. Given time, they usually warm up to visitors.   \n",
