They will follow their humans from room to room, and sleep in bed with them, preferably under the covers, cuddled as close as possible. At play, they will turn around to see if their human is watching and being entertained by their crazy antics.   \n",

Being naturally inquisitive, the Havana Brown reaches out with a paw to touch and feel when investigating curiosities in its environment. They are truly sensitive by nature and frequently gently touch their human companions as if they are extending a paw of friendship.   \n",

Sensitive to their owner’s moods, Colorpoints are more than happy to sit at your side or on your lap and purr words of encouragement on a bad day. They will constantly seek out your lap whenever it is open and in the moments when your lap is preoccupied they will stretch out in sunny spots on the ground.   \n",

They will follow their humans from room to room, and sleep in bed with them, preferably under the covers, cuddled as close as possible. At play, they will turn around to see if their human is watching and being entertained by their crazy antics.   \n",
       "3  The Havana Brown is human oriented, playful, and curious. She has a strong desire to spend time with her people and involve herself in everything they do. Being naturally inquisitive, the Havana Brown reaches out with a paw to touch and feel when investigating curiosities in its environment. They are truly sensitive by nature and frequently gently touch their human companions as if they are extending a paw of friendship.   \n",

Sensitive to their owner’s moods, Colorpoints are more than happy to sit at your side or on your lap and purr words of encouragement on a bad day. They will constantly seek out your lap whenever it is open and in the moments when your lap is preoccupied they will stretch out in sunny spots on the ground.   \n",

The LaPerm will often follow your lead; that is, if they are busy playing and you decide to sit and relax, simply pick up your LaPerm and sit down with it, and it will stay in your lap, devouring the attention you give it.   \n",

She is territorial and patrols several times each day to make certain that all is fine.   \n",
