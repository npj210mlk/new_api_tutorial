They love having fun, don’t mind the company of other cats and dogs, also love to curl up for a sleep in a safe place. Exotics love their own people, but around strangers they are cautious at first. Given time, they usually warm up to visitors.   \n",

       "6  The Norwegian Forest Cat is a sweet, loving cat. She appreciates praise and loves to interact with her parent. She makes a loving companion and bonds with her parents once she accepts them for her own. She is still a hunter at heart. She loves to chase toys as if they are real. She is territorial and patrols several times each day to make certain that all is fine.   \n",

Her tail should be handled gently. Folds are known for sleeping on their backs, and for sitting with their legs stretched out and their paws on their belly. This is called the \"Buddha Position\".   \n",
