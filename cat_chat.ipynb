       "0                               Arabian Mau cats are social and energetic. Due to their energy levels, these cats do best in homes where their owners will be able to provide them with plenty of playtime, attention and interaction from their owners. These kitties are friendly, intelligent, and adaptable, and will even get along well with other pets and children.   \n",

Extremely intelligent, curious and active, they demand a lot of interaction and woe betide the owner who doesn't provide it.   \n",
       "2             The Birman is a docile, quiet cat who loves people and will follow them from room to room. Expect the Birman to want to be involved in what you’re doing. He communicates in a soft voice, mainly to remind you that perhaps it’s time for dinner or maybe for a nice cuddle on the sofa. He enjoys being held and will relax in your arms like a furry baby.   \n",

They tend to enjoy jumping to great heights, playing with fishing pole-type or other interactive toys and just generally investigating their surroundings. He will attempt to copy things you do, such as opening doors or drawers.   \n",

She has lots of energy and is faster and more agile than she looks. The shortness of their legs does not seem to interfere with their running and leaping abilities.   \n",
       "6  The Scottish Fold is a sweet, charming breed. She is an easy cat to live with and to care for. She is affectionate and is comfortable with all members of her family. Her tail should be handled gently. Folds are known for sleeping on their backs, and for sitting with their legs stretched out and their paws on their belly. This is called the \"Buddha Position\".   \n",

He climbs higher, jumps farther, plays harder. Nothing escapes the notice of this highly intelligent and inquisitive cat. Somalis love the company of humans and other animals.   \n",

With its affectionate and playful personality the Angora is a top choice for families. The Angora gets along great with other pets in the home, but it will make clear who is in charge, and who the house belongs to   \n",

Due to their energy levels, these cats do best in homes where their owners will be able to provide them with plenty of playtime, attention and interaction from their owners. These kitties are friendly, intelligent, and adaptable, and will even get along well with other pets and children.   \n",

Extremely intelligent, curious and active, they demand a lot of interaction and woe betide the owner who doesn't provide it.   \n",
       "2  The Birman is a docile, quiet cat who loves people and will follow them from room to room. Expect the Birman to want to be involved in what you’re doing. He communicates in a soft voice, mainly to remind you that perhaps it’s time for dinner or maybe for a nice cuddle on the sofa. He enjoys being held and will relax in your arms like a furry baby.   \n",
